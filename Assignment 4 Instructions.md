# Lesson 5: Python Tuples and Dictionaries

##### TABLE OF CONTENTS


## 1. Tuple list number and its square of that number.
### 1. Instruction:
Write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the square of the number.

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)].

### 1. My Solution:
[tuple_list-number_and_its_square_of_that_number.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/209dd5c5f7440bf279bbd83bcec9e6aa254e8743/Assignment%204/tuple_list-number_and_its_square_of_that_number.py)

## 2. Tuples finding divisible.
### 2. Instruction:
Write a program that will ask user to input a list of integer tuples. Ask also for another integer value and assign it to K. Output the tuple that are divisible by K.

### 2. My Solution:
[tuples-finding_divisible.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/ba6d62882305ab343d241d250bd246840a4c238f/Assignment%204/tuples-finding_divisible.py)

## 3. Dictionary Months and Days.
### 3. Instruction:
Here is a dictionary of the days in the months of the year:

days = {'January':31, 'February':28, 'March':31, 'April':30, 'May':31, 'June':30, 'July':31, 'August':31, 'September':30, 'October':31, 'November':30, 'December':31}

- Ask the user to enter a month name and use the dictionary to tell them how many days are in the month.
- Print out all of the keys in alphabetical order.
- Print out all of the months with 31 days.
- Print out the (key-value) pairs sorted by the number of days in each month.

### 3. My Solution:
[month_day_dictionary.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/119c51fd994b6d66943c3c0d7f6f3f8c6c0fea71/Assignment%204/month_day_dictionary.py)

## 4. Dictionary Products and Prices.
### 4. Instruction:
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter product names and prices. Store all of these in a dictionary whose keys are the product names and whose values are the prices. When the user is done entering products and prices, allow them to repeatedly enter a product name and print the corresponding price or a message if the product is not in the dictionary.

### 4. My Solution:
[products_and_prices.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/ab42fd8c501f651a464e35b19fee6b242ca1d29b/Assignment%204/products_and_prices.py)
