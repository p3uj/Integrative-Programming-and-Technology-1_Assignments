# Lesson 5: Python Tuples and Dictionaries

##### TABLE OF CONTENTS


## 1. Tuple list number and its square of that number.
### 1. Instruction:
Write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the square of the number.

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)].

## 2. Tuples finding divisible.
### 2. Instruction:
Write a program that will ask user to input a list of integer tuples. Ask also for another integer value and assign it to K. Output the tuple that are divisible by K.
