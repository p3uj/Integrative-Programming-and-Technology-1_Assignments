# Lesson 5: Python Tuples and Dictionaries

##### TABLE OF CONTENTS


## 1. Tuple list number and its square of that number.
### 1. Instruction:
Write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the square of the number.

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)].

### 1. My Solution:
[tuple_list-number_and_its_square_of_that_number.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/209dd5c5f7440bf279bbd83bcec9e6aa254e8743/Assignment%204/tuple_list-number_and_its_square_of_that_number.py)

## 2. Tuples finding divisible.
### 2. Instruction:
Write a program that will ask user to input a list of integer tuples. Ask also for another integer value and assign it to K. Output the tuple that are divisible by K.

### 2. My Solution:
[tuples-finding_divisible.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/ba6d62882305ab343d241d250bd246840a4c238f/Assignment%204/tuples-finding_divisible.py)

## 3. Dictionary Months and Days.
### 3. Instruction:
Here is a dictionary of the days in the months of the year:

days = {'January':31, 'February':28, 'March':31, 'April':30, 'May':31, 'June':30, 'July':31, 'August':31, 'September':30, 'October':31, 'November':30, 'December':31}

- Ask the user to enter a month name and use the dictionary to tell them how many days are in the month.
- Print out all of the keys in alphabetical order.
- Print out all of the months with 31 days.
- Print out the (key-value) pairs sorted by the number of days in each month.

### 3. My Solution:
[month_day_dictionary.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/119c51fd994b6d66943c3c0d7f6f3f8c6c0fea71/Assignment%204/month_day_dictionary.py)

## 4. Dictionary Products and Prices.
### 4. Instruction:
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter product names and prices. Store all of these in a dictionary whose keys are the product names and whose values are the prices. When the user is done entering products and prices, allow them to repeatedly enter a product name and print the corresponding price or a message if the product is not in the dictionary.

### 4. My Solution:
[products_and_prices.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/ab42fd8c501f651a464e35b19fee6b242ca1d29b/Assignment%204/products_and_prices.py)

## 5. Dictionary Accounts Credentials.
### 5. Instruction:
Write a program that uses a dictionary that contains ten user names and passwords. The program should ask the user to enter their username and password.

If the username is not in the dictionary, the program should indicate that the person is not a valid user of the system.

If the username is in the dictionary, but the user does not enter the right password, the program should say that the password is invalid.

If the password is correct, then the program should tell the user that they are now logged in to the system.

### 5. My Solution:
[user_name_and_password.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/aff470dae01c8dcee6e5cae4a531699d1fcbd2d9/Assignment%204/user_name_and_password.py)
