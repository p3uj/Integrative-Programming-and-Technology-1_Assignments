## 1. List using append and concatenation.
### 1. Instruction:
Create a list with the following six items: 67, 62.9, “hi”, False, 8, 67, ‘apple’, 6.5. Begin with the empty list shown below, and add 8 statements to add each item, one per item. The first four statements should use the append method to append the item to the list, and the last four statements should use concatenation.

### 1. My Solution:
[creating_a_list_using_append_and_concatenation.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/366b1e5369f21b118926f81f7ffdd53d87f45618/Assignment%203/creating_a_list_using_append_and_concatenation.py)

## 2. Previous List. Do the following statement.
### 2. Instruction:
Starting with the list of the previous exercise, write Python statements to do the following:

a.	Append “banana” and 67 to the list.

b.	Insert the value “dog” at position 3.

c.	Insert the value 909 at the start of the list.

d.	Find the index of “hi”.

e.	Count the number of 67s in the list.

f.	Remove the first occurrence of 67 from the list.

g.	Remove False from the list using pop and index

### 2. My Solution:

## 3. List Operations - Sum, Last, Reverse, Contains 5, Less than 5, Sorted.
### 3. Instruction:
Write a program that asks the user to enter size of list and input a list of integers. Do the following:

- Print the sum of items in the list.
- Print the last item in the list.
- Print the list in reverse order.
- Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.
- Print how many integers in the list are less than 5.
- Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the result.


### 3. My Solution:
[List Operations - Sum, Last, Reverse, Contains 5, Less than 5, Sorted.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/e5c76c91fec2e28782dd6c2f1af8db19142864df/Assignment%203/List%20Operations%20-%20Sum%2C%20Last%2C%20Reverse%2C%20Contains%205%2C%20Less%20than%205%2C%20Sorted.py)

## 4. List Transformation.
### 4. Instruction:
Start with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:

- Set the second entry (index 1) to 17.
- Add 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list.
- Remove the first entry from the list.
- Sort the list.
- Double the list f. Insert 25 at index 3.
- The final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17].


### 4. My Solution:
[list transformation.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/bc2a82663637f7216aa28b62c073e8285b6d7106/Assignment%203/list%20transformation.py)

## 5. Factors of an Integer.
### 5. Instruction:
Write a program that asks the user for an integer and creates a list that consists of the factors of that integer.

### 5. My Solution:
[factors of the integer.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/d2c7bf5d785608be4c51973bfc6e376f2759cfd7/Assignment%203/factors%20of%20the%20integer.py)

## 6. Remove Repeated Items from the List.
### 6. Instruction:
Write a program that removes any repeated items from a list so that each item appears at most once. For instance, the list [1,1,2,3,4,3,0,0] would become [1,2,3,4,0].

### 6. My Solution:
[remove repeated items from the list.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/2003d6d1e1ccd7e28648d3de964f7671eaec23a6/Assignment%203/remove%20repeated%20items%20from%20the%20list.py)
