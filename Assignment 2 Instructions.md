# Lesson 2: Python Flow Control

##### TABLE OF CONTENTS


## 1. Centimeters to Inches.
### 1. Instruction:
Write a program that ask the user to enter a length in centimeters. If the user enters a negative length, the program should tell the user that the entry is invalid. Otherwise, the program should convert the length to inches and print out the result. There are 2.4 centimeters in an inch.

### 1. My Solution:
[centimetersToInches.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/ba67ddea5e28c2940af086022f04ab44dfacac78/Assignment%202/centimetersToInches.py)

## 2. Convert temperature unit to other unit - celsius or fahrenheit.
### 2. Instruction:
Ask the user for a temperature. Then ask them what units, Celsius or Fahrenheit, the temperature is in. Your program should convert the temperature to the other unit. The conversions are F = 9/5 * C + 32 and C = 5/9 (F - 32).

### 2. My Solution:
[convertUnitToTemOrCel.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/c3311774815c2b7d89767acc750f8469ad7a29df/Assignment%202/convertUnitToTemOrCel.py)

## 3. Celsius and Message.
### 3. Instruction:
Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. The program should print a message based on the temperature:
- If the temperature is less than -273.15, print that the temperature is invalid because it is below absolute zero.
- If it is exactly -273.15, print that the temperature is absolute 0.
- If the temperature is between -273.15 and 0, print that the temperature is below freezing.
- If it is 0, print that the temperature is at the freezing point.
- If it is between 0 and 100, print that the temperature is in the normal range.
- If it is 100, print that the temperature is at the boiling point.
- If it is above 100, print that the temperature is above the boiling point.


### 3. My Solution:
[celsiusAndMessage.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/d5fb2a0283c26eba5488d9fe9af72610d8907fd6/Assignment%202/celsiusAndMessage.py)

## 4. Credits and Corresponding Message.
### 4. Instruction:
Write a program that asks the user how many credits they have taken. If they have taken 23 or less, print that the student is a freshman. If they have taken between 24 and 53, print that they are a sophomore. The range for juniors is 54 to 83, and for seniors it is 84 and over.


### 4. My Solution:
[creditsAndCorrespondingMessage.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/8bea20532e2cf91945cdb4202a3778fddfe160c7/Assignment%202/creditsAndCorrespondingMessage.py)

## 5. Leap Year or Not.
### 5. Instruction:
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except that years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. Write a program that asks the user for a year and prints out whether it is a leap year or not.

### 5. My Solution:
[leapYear.py](https://github.com/p3uj/Integrative-Programming-and-Technology-1_Assignments/blob/801aa4deb98ac62fd71f1d61503779fe94c03b15/Assignment%202/leapYear.py)
